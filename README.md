Issues:
- I can't figure out why the toggle function isn't working when I click on the boxes. I see it toggling on dev tools but I'm not sure why it's not turning white. 
- The fortunes do not appear on the bottom after the final round of clicks. 

Resources:
- Lectures provided to us in the modules.
- Tyrion Austin was a huge help for switching to the next set of colors. He explained how to incorporate the setTimeout function to complete this. He also tried helping me with the fortune issue I had but we were unable to figure out how to make it appear.
